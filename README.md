# dimensional

This project aims to create a statically typed system for dimensional analysis of variables. It is never correct to add a value in meters per second to a value in meters, this will catch that, among other related issues.

This is currently in a proof-of-concept state; the concept and execution has been proven but it has yet to be developed into a fully capable system.
